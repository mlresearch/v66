abstract: This paper describes an approach using wearables to demonstrate the viability of measuring physiometric arousal indicators such as heart rate in assessing how urban built environments can induce physiometric arousal indicators in a subject. In addition, a machine learning methodology is developed to classify sensor inputs based on annotated arousal output as a target. The results are then used as a foundation for designing and implementing an aﬀective intelligent systems framework for arousal state detection via supervised learning and classiﬁcation.
